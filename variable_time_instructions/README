The following actions are taken:

1. The instruction_tables.ods spreadsheet is initially downloaded from https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.ods.
   The sheets here are already somewhat parsed to only include instructions, operands and latencies for the available CPUs.
   Additional modifications have also been done to make automatic parsing easier and more accurate.
   The data is based on the 2021-01-31 version of the spreadsheet.

2. The raw data in raw/ is filtered into filtered/ using filter.py. Possible filters are:
   - 'simple': takes anything that is not clearly a constant; may contain many false positives
   - 'clear': takes anything that is clearly a variable latency; may filter-out some weird-formatted instructions
   - 'strong': same as clear, but only accepts latencies that vary by more than one cycle

3. The filtered data is merged using count.py. The result contains the number of CPUs in the dataset on which the instructions
   are variable-time
   count.py makes it easy to obtain a list of instructions which are variable time in multiple CPUs, e.g.

       python scripts/count.py <filtered files> | while read line; do [[ "02" < "$line" ]] && echo "$line"; done

4. The merged data is manually filtered, since there may be false positives depending on the filter used

To avoid false positives, it may be useful to consider only a subset of the data in raw/, e.g. only modern processors.
