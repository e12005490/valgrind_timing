(Pentium 4 data is not taken into account (yet) because I have no clue what I'm supposed to think when I see floating-point latencies)

The following actions are taken:

1. The instruction_tables.ods spreadsheet is initially downloaded from https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.ods.
   The sheets here are already somewhat parsed to only include instructions, operands and latencies for the available CPUs.
   The data is based on the 2021-01-31 version of the spreadsheet.
2. The raw data in raw/ is filtered into filtered/ using filter.py
3. The filtered data is merged as merged.txt using merge.py
4. The merged data is manually filtered into variable.txt, since there are false positives
5. variable.txt contains all instructions that are variable time in AT LEAST ONE OF THE LISTED CPUs,
   MEANING A LOT OF FALSE POSITIVES

To avoid false positives, it may be useful to consider only a subset of the data in raw/, e.g. only modern processors.
