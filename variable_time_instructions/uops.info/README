The raw data in uops.info.csv has been downloaded from https://uops.info/table.html
on 2021-04-21.

This data is split into files corresponding to individual microarchitecture
in uops.info/<arch>.csv.

The script uops.info/filter.py generates corresponding uops.info/filtered-<arch>.csv
containing instructions that are
	1. present in the microarchitecture (i.e. the latency is not empty)
	2. not marked as constant time (i.e. the latency is not just a number)

The script uops.info/count.py takes filtered files as input and writes to
standard output instructions along with the number of architectures on
which they are marked variable-time.

The script uops.info/without-memory calls uops.info/count.py, but filters
the output to remove instructions containing memory operands to remove
cache effects, which are already known to produce timing variations.
