This is an extension of Valgrind/memcheck to help better detect timing
vulnerabilities based on Valgrind 3.16.1.

The only modified file in the Valgrind source is memcheck/mc_translate.c.
Memcheck now detects divisions with undefined operands, and can be used
as in https://www.post-apocalyptic-crypto.org/timecop/ to detect secret
branches, secret lookups and variable-time instructions (currently divisions).

To build the sources, run

	cd valgrind-3.16.1
	./autogen-sh
	./configure --prefix=`pwd`/inst
	make
	make install

The Valgrind binary can then be found under inst/bin/valgrind.
