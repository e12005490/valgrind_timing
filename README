This is an extension of Valgrind/memcheck to help better detect timing
vulnerabilities based on Valgrind 3.16.1.

The only modified file in the Valgrind source is memcheck/mc_translate.c.
Memcheck now detects divisions with undefined operands, and can be used
as in https://www.post-apocalyptic-crypto.org/timecop/ to detect secret
branches, secret lookups and variable-time instructions (currently divisions).

To build the sources, run

	cd valgrind-3.16.1
	./autogen-sh
	./configure --prefix=`pwd`/inst
	make
	make install

The Valgrind binary can then be found under inst/bin/valgrind.


The timecop-data.xz file contains SUPERCOP (version 20210125) output data
related to TIMECOP tests obtained using the modified Valgrind build.


The variable_time_instructions directory contains data on instructions
that are variable-time on different microarchitectures.


The benchmark directory contains a small kernel module adapted from
https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/ia-32-ia-64-benchmark-code-execution-paper.pdf
to gather some data about the average cycle count of instructions. Currently,
the module outputs the mean and variance of the execution time of the code
to benchmark.
